  title: 'Building Software That [Evolves Without Entropy]{.text-primary}'
  description: 'I design and build software systems that continue to evolve and improve without drifting into entropy, collapsing under complexity, or slowing to a crawl. Through event-driven architecture, domain-driven design, and clean architectural principles, I create systems that remain flexible, robust, maintainable, testable, and scalable as your business grows.'

    - title: Business-Driven, Not Data-Driven
      description: Every architectural decision serves a clear business purpose. While data is readily available for analytics and insights, business objectives drive the architecture. Technology serves the business, not the other way around.
